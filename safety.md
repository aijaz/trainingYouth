# Student Safety

There will be only two or three people who will have physical or online access to the students: 

1. The MYPI Training coordinator
2. The Head of Training (Aijaz Ansari)
3. The Instructor (currently also Aijaz Ansari)

Any person who takes one any of these roles will have to have passed a background check within the last 12 months and should be able to provide proof of this background check on demand. Background checks will be performed by [CIA Research][cia].

All staff will be expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct][cc] when interacting with students, whether in class, or outside of class hours, and even after the program has completed and the student is no-longer enrolled in the program.
