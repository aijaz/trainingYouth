# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct is a living document. The most recent version can be found on our website at https://aijaz.github.io/trainingYouth/cc

This code of conduct applies to everyone who attends any of our training events, instructors, staff, guest instructors, and students.

Harassment won't be tolerated at MYPI events. What is harassment? It includes: 
offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. It also includes things not listed above. If you feel that you are being harassed, or you see someone being harassed, please inform your instructor, and the MYPI administrator. 

We assume that people who attend are training our good people who don't want to be offensive to others. If we get a report of harassment, we will ask the person to stop it (most likely in private). Anyone asked to stop harassing behaviour is expected to comply immediately. If that doesn't work, they will be asked to leave immediately, and steps will be taken to ensure that that happens. 

MYPI training events are kid-friendly events. To borrow an analogy from the movie industry, we ask that everyone keep everything G-rated. Not PG. G. This means that instructors are not to use sexualised images, pictorial or otherwise, in their content. 

No one attending our events, whether in person or online, should use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a student engages in harassing behavior, MYPI staff may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the student or expulsion from the program and confiscation of the laptop that they provided them. 

Instructors and guest speakers will have additional constraints: Given that students might be below the age of consent, any observed inappropriate physical contact or sexual attention towards such students may be reported to law enforcement immediately. Even if students are adults, instructors and guest speakers are prohibited from having any romantic or physical relationship with students. Violations of the student-teacher relationship will be dealt with immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. 
 
__We expect everyone to follow these rules at all MYPI training events without exception.__
