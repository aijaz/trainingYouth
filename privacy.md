# Data Privacy

The following data will be collected for each student:

- Name
- Year of birth. We don't need to know their birth date, but we would have to teach 12-year-olds very differently than 17-year-olds, for example. 
- Phone number (for communication via WhatsApp). If the student is less than 18 years old, the phone number must be that of a parent or guardian, and not the student.
- Shipping address: For shipping the laptop to the student
- Sponsor
- All information will be stored encrypted at rest. 

The storage of student data may be outsourced to a third party such as [Remind][].
