# Risks

These are the risks that I have identified that could cause some details of the program to change:

## Social Distancing due to COVID-19

Ideally, each class would be held in a room large enough to hold the instructor and all students. However, with social distancing being the norm for the forseeable future, the classes will have to be conducted online. Given that requirement, the best option would be to use [Zoom][], [Hopin][], or [Mmhmm][]. 

## Lack of Reliable Internet Access for the Students

This type of program depends on the students having reliable internet access for the weekly "in-person" sessions. These are the minimum requirements that each service suggests:

- Zoom: 0.6Mb/s
- Hopin: 5Mb/s
- Mmhmm: Unknown (It's in beta as of July 9, 2020)

If a student doesn't have access to Internet Service at this speed, we would have to look for local establishments like libraries or businesses that can sponsor the student's access by giving them a place from where they can attend the class. This is not a scalable solution, because there are many variables, such as where the student lives, whether they have access to transportation, etc. 

## Inadequate Sponsorship

While the cost of this program is [$1,000 per student][value], the minimal cost is approximately $360 per student---the cost of a Chromebook. The table shows the minimal cost based on the number of students, and how many sponsored students we would need (at $1,000 per sponsorship) to meet those minimal costs:

| Number of Students | Minimal Cost | Number of Sponsorships Required to meet Minimal Cost |
| ---: |     ---: | ---: |
|    1 |     $360 |    1 |
|    2 |     $720 |    1 |
|    3 |   $1,080 |    2 |
|    4 |   $1,440 |    2 |
|    5 |   $1,800 |    2 |
|    6 |   $2,160 |    3 |
|    7 |   $2,520 |    3 |
|    8 |   $2,880 |    3 |
|    9 |   $3,240 |    4 |
|   10 |   $3,600 |    4 |
|   11 |   $3,960 |    4 |
|   12 |   $4,320 |    5 |
|   13 |   $4,680 |    5 |
|   14 |   $5,040 |    6 |
|   15 |   $5,400 |    6 |
|   16 |   $5,760 |    6 |
