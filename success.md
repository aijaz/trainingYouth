# The Definition of Success

How do we measure success? If a student completes the program and leaves with an app that they made by themselves, that's clearly a successful outcome. But what about the student who comes to us in week three saying, "You know, I thought I would love coding. But I absolutely hate how dull this is, and I never want to do this again in my life." What about them?

I would call that a successful outcome, as well. Better they learn than now, than after spending two years of misery in a CS program in college. Essentially, any outcome where the student attends regularly and is engaged with earnest is a successful outcome.
