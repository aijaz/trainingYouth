# Why Assign a Dollar Value

I've been a volunteering in one capacity or the other for the last 30 years. During that time I've learned that if we don't assign a value to a product or service, then that product or service is perceived as having no worth. A project such as this can only be successful if the students feel that they are getting something valuable. Something worth having. Lacking that, interest and attendance can wane if the class becomes difficult. 

Another reason to assign a dollar value to each enrollment and look for sponsorships is that we want this project to be self-sufficient and viable in the long term. We want this to be in an organization's best interest to conduct these classes. To use a clich√©, it's a win-win. For both, the students and the organization conducting the classes. Also, those laptops aren't free.

Finally, another thing that I have noticed in the last three decades of volunteering is that even the best-intentioned volunteers are only human. They may start a project with a lot of enthusiasm, but not see it through to completion. There are often good reasons for that: They may get busy at work, or school. They may get married, or take on more responsibilities at home. When we pay our volunteers (even if it's only a token amount) we're communicating to them that "This is a committment." They're committing to putting in the effort to see this project to completion. Sixteen youth are relying on them. This is not something they do _when they have the time._ Once money changes hands---no matter how little---it gets serious.
