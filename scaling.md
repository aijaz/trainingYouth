# Scaling the Program

The goal of this project is to be able to provide this training to whoever wants it. We don't want to turn anyone away. Logistically, we can only have a maximum of 16 students per session. More than that, and we may lose the ability to give individual attention to students during the training sessions. 

This website, and the associate Git repository will store high-level curriculums as well as detailed syllabi so that we can duplicate this effort by adding more instructors and sponsors. We should not be starting from scratch every time. To prevent burnout, I would not recommend that a single instructor conduct more than one session at any point in time.
