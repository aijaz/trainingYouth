# Introduction

My name is [Aijaz Ansari][me] and I work at [Gogo Business Aviation][ba] in Broomfield, Colorado. I also volunteer as a Member of the Board at [MYPI][mypi], which is an organization dedicated to serving youth. 

One of the goals of MYPI is to "work to remove institutional barriers for youth of color to succeed." There is no single strategy that is guaranteed to work to serve our Black youth. Every one of us has different skills, and we should use them to reach our goals. Mine happens to be teaching. This project is an effort to teach programming (coding) to youth in our communities. 

I have conducted this sort of program three times in the past, in Chicago. The first time was for young children, and the other two was for adults looking to learn new skills. In fact I got my job at Gogo through one of these programs---one of my students was a Gogo employee who told me about the job opening. In my experience, the program as [designed][summary] is long enough to teach someone programming and have them complete with a tangible, working app or game.
