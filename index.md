# Training Youth Home

## Introduction

My name is [Aijaz Ansari][me] and I work at [Gogo Business Aviation][ba] in Broomfield, Colorado. I also volunteer as a Member of the Board at [MYPI][mypi], which is an organization dedicated to serving youth. 

One of the goals of MYPI is to "work to remove institutional barriers for youth of color to succeed." There is no single strategy that is guaranteed to work to serve our Black youth. Every one of us has different skills, and we should them to reach our goals. Mine happens to be teaching. This project is an effort to teach programming (coding) to youth in our communities.
